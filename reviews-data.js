        review: "Amazing experience with 1st Step! My instructor was patient and professional. I passed my G2 test on the first try. The tI'm grateful to have found Driver Instructor Tahir Mirza. His guidance was invaluable. With just a few practical lessons of G class, he encouraged me to take the road test at Oakville Drive Test Center instead of Guelph. I passed my G license on the first attempt with only 3 minor mistakes! Mirza’s patience, expertise, and clear instructions, I've become a confident, skilled, and safe driver. His constructive feedback was greatly appreciated. Highly recommended! Thank you, @Mirza, and thank you to the Brocode Group for connecting me with such an excellent instructor!heory classes were comprehensive and the practical lessons really prepared me for real-world driving. Highly recommend!",

        review: "Before taking my first lesson I did not have any knowledge on driving on Canadian roads and had barely driven at my home country….Tahir told me to take 10 lessons and will make me clear G test on my first attempt (I was like he is kidding)…..During these 10 lessons Tahir worked really hard on my driving skills gave me the confidence which was clearly lacking earlier and was very patient, calm and composed ….Although i was giving G test directly he made sure taught me all the parkings….After taking all 10 lessons guess what I cleared my G Test on 1st attempt at Oakville and Tahir proved his words which he told on Day 1….Tahir will not only make sure you clear the test but will make you a good driver for life….Highly Recommend!!!",

        review: "It was an amazing experience, the instructor, Tahir Mirza was very professional and explained everything very clearly and thoroughly. He is very friendly as well and would not let you be nervous about anything you can ask him any questions and he will guide you through. I planned on getting 10 classes but after 6 classes he advised me not to take more classes as per him I was completely trained and good for my G2 test. I was through on my very first attempt of my G2 exam. All credit goes to Tahir Mirza. Highly recommended!",

        review: "My experience is with Mirza the instructor, he gave my daughter driving lessons for short while. I wasn’t satisfied with the previous driving school my daughter attended, Mirza was recommended by a friend that he’s very good at what he does, he said after 10 classes his students should be ready to do the road test. Mirza is very patient and kind and even go an extra mile to make sure his students are ready for the road test. He was very confident that my daughter was ready for the road test . My daughter developed confidence in driving all because of Mirza. I definitely recommend him to anyone who is looking for a competent, experienced, reliable, knowledgeable and capable driving instructor, he’s all of that Thank you Mirza for giving my daughter the confidence she needed and the experience she gained from your teaching she was able to pass her road test. Thank you 0nce again.",

        review: "I had Mirza as my instructor and he was incredibly kind and patient throughout the process. He helped me prepare for my G2 test in a short amount of time—and I passed! What I appreciated most was how he explained different driving scenarios that could happen on the road, helping me understand how to be a safe and confident driver. When I didn’t fully grasp something verbally, he would take the time to explain it visually using a toy car and a small blackboard. This approach made a huge difference for me as I am a visual learner.10/10 would recommend!",
